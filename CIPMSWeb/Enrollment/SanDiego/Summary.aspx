                    The San Diego One Happy Camper program, sponsored by the Jewish Federation of San Diego County and the Foundation for Jewish Camp, provides grants to encourage children to attend a overnight Jewish camp for the first-time.
			    </p>
                <p>
                    This is not a scholarship fund and is not needs-based. Our goal is to engage families who are considering sending their children to camp and, in effect, to give them up to $1,000 off their camp fee to try a Jewish one.
                </p>
				<p>
				    The following outlines the eligibility criteria for this program:
                    <ul style="font-weight: bold">
                        <li>$1,000 grants awarded to first-time campers attending camp for 19 or more consecutive days.</li>
                        <li>$700 grants awarded to first-time campers attending camp for 12-18 consecutive days.</li>
                        <li>Siblings of campers who previously received a grant are eligible to receive $500 when they attend camp for the first time for at least 12 consecutive days.</li>
                        <li>First time camper must be entering grades 1-12 (after camp).</li>
                        <li>Attending one of the 155+ non-profit, Jewish, overnight summer camps listed on the Foundation for Jewish Camp’s website (<a href="http://www.OneHappyCamper.org/FindaCamp" target="_blank">www.OneHappyCamper.org/FindaCamp</a>).</li>
                    </ul>
				</p>                
				<p>
                    This program is an outreach initiative for children who are not currently receiving an immersive, daily Jewish experience. As such, children who attend Jewish day school or Yeshiva are not eligible for this program.
				</p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Who is a First Time Camper?</span> First time campers are defined as any camper who is attending nonprofit Jewish overnight camp for the first time for 2 consecutive weeks (12 days) or longer. If the camper has previously attended a Jewish overnight camp for less than 2 weeks (12 days) he/she is still eligible.
