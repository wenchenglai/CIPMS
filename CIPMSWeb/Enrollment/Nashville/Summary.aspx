                    The Jewish Federation of Nashville and Middle Tennessee One Happy Camper Program provide grants to encourage children to attend overnight Jewish camp for the first-time. 
                    It is not a scholarship fund and is not needs-based. Our goal is to engage families who are considering sending their children to camp, and in effect, 
                    giving them $1,000 off their camp fee to try a Jewish one.
                </p>
				<p>

                    This program is an outreach initiative for children who are not currently receiving an immersive, daily Jewish experience. As such, 
                    children who attend Jewish Day School or yeshiva are not eligible for this incentive program.
